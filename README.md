# Robust Map Fusion with Visual Attention Utilizing Multi-agent Rendezvous [ICRA 2023]
[[Paper Link]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10161072)
## About
This repository contains the official implementation of Frame-Error-Estimator, which aligns the coordinates of two occupancy grid maps.
We also attatch the link to download weight files and our dataset to reproduce the reported results or utilize for your own purpose.
The implementation of Vision Transformer is cloned from [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch) and modified to return encoded features.
